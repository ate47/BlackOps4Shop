## Diclaimers

- I'm French, so the names are in French, I've tried to rename them, but not all the names are the same.
- I've completed all the operation except the 1st (season 0, ~120 tiers), so season items can be missing, the weapons were added to the list even if they were in a season.
- I'm not a huge counter, so some values can be wrong (try to count 2000 items to see...)
